      		<h1 id="In-RAY-DONOVAN-What-Was-the-Name-of-the-Casino-That-Raised-Dad-Were-That-Nietzsche"><a href="#In-RAY-DONOVAN-What-Was-the-Name-of-the-Casino-That-Raised-Dad-Were-That-Nietzsche" class="headerlink" title="In RAY DONOVAN, What Was the Name of the Casino That Raised Dad Were That Nietzsche?"></a>In RAY DONOVAN, What Was the Name of the Casino That Raised Dad Were That Nietzsche?</h1><p>This is a question that has plagued fans of the Showtime series “Ray Donovan” for years. In the Season 2 episode “Bucky Fuckin’ Dent,” Ray (played by Liev Schreiber) and his dad, Mickey (portrayed by Jon Voight), discuss Ray’s future prospects. Part of this discussion includes mention of a casino that “raised” Mickey. The name of the casino is never actually given, but many fans have speculated that it was the Nietzsche Casino.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why this speculation is reasonable. For one, the Nietzsche Casino is mentioned earlier in the same episode when Bunchy (played by Dash Mihok) tells Terry (portrayed by Eddie Marsan) about how his brother, Darryl, was killed there. Secondly, the Nietzsche Casino is located in Las Vegas, which is where much of the action in “Ray Donovan” takes place. Finally, the show’s creators have never explicitly denied that the Nietzsche Casino is the casino in question.</p>
<p>So why hasn’t Showtime confirmed whether or not the Nietzsche Casino is indeed the casino that raised Mickey? It’s possible that they don’t want to give away too much information about the show’s plot. After all, there are still plenty of surprises in store for viewers. But whatever the reason may be, it’s sure to be interesting to see how things play out on “Ray Donovan” and whether or not the Nietzsche Casino finally gets named.</p>
<h1 id="Nietzsche-is-at-the-Center-of-Another-Hollywood-Scandal"><a href="#Nietzsche-is-at-the-Center-of-Another-Hollywood-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="Nietzsche is at the Center of Another Hollywood Scandal!"></a>Nietzsche is at the Center of Another Hollywood Scandal!</h1><p>It would seem that Friedrich Nietzsche is at the center of another Hollywood scandal, though this time it is not one of his ideas that is causing trouble. The latest issue surrounds an upcoming film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman, both of whom are set to portray nineteenth century philosophers. In order to accurately portray his character, DiCaprio has been studying Nietzsche intensively and it seems that he has taken on some of the German philosopher’s more controversial views.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, DiCaprio stated that “Nietzsche was saying that God doesn’t exist, but we kind of replaced Him with ideologies like communism and fascism. So what he was essentially doing was trying to liberate humans from all these false idols so we could become who we are truly meant to be.” This statement has quickly drawn criticism from religious groups around the world, many of whom have accused the actor of promoting atheism.</p>
<p>It seems clear that DiCaprio is not actually endorsing Nietzsche’s views but is simply trying to understand his character better. However, this has not stopped people from getting upset and the film is already facing backlash before it has even been released. Whether or not this will have a negative impact on its box office sales remains to be seen, but it is definitely something that the filmmakers will have to deal with.</p>
<h1 id="What-Caused-the-Fallout-Between-Ray-Donovan-and-His-Father"><a href="#What-Caused-the-Fallout-Between-Ray-Donovan-and-His-Father" class="headerlink" title="What Caused the Fallout Between Ray Donovan and His Father?"></a>What Caused the Fallout Between Ray Donovan and His Father?</h1><p>The Showtime drama Ray Donovan characterizes the struggles of a family whose father is a powerful Hollywood fixer and the son is a professional “fixer” himself. The show has been praised for its complex plot, well-drawn characters, and gritty realism. But even with all its strengths, the series has been plagued by rumors of behind-the-scenes turmoil. One of the most headline-grabbing stories to come out of the show is the fallout between actor Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan) and his father, actor&#x2F;director Sydney Pollack.</p>
<p>The two had a famously difficult relationship both on and off the set. In one interview, Schreiber recounted how his father would criticize him mercilessly when he was growing up. “He would say things to me like, ‘You’re not good enough. You’ll never be good enough,’” Schreiber said. “I don’t think he ever really believed that I could do this or be successful.”</p>
<p>Aside from personal issues, there may have also been creative clashes between the two men. Sydney Pollack was known for being a demanding director who was very particular about how he wanted scenes shot. He is said to have clashed with his son over how to portray Ray Donovan onscreen. In one interview, Schreiber’s mother said that her husband “wanted it done his way and Liev didn’t want it done his way.”</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for their disputes, the rift between father and son was clearly evident onscreen. In one particularly heated argument in season 2, Ray rails at his dad: “You think you can just control everything! You’re not God!” It’s clear that their conflict runs deep and still affects both men to this day.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-to-Blame-for-the-Downfall-of-the-Donovan-Family"><a href="#Who-is-to-Blame-for-the-Downfall-of-the-Donovan-Family" class="headerlink" title="Who is to Blame for the Downfall of the Donovan Family?"></a>Who is to Blame for the Downfall of the Donovan Family?</h1><p>The Donovan family was once among the most prominent in the United States. But starting in the late 1990s, the family began to experience a series of setbacks, culminating in their complete collapse by the early 2000s. Many have blamed different members of the family for this downfall, but who is really to blame?</p>
<p>One common theory is that Michael Donovan, the head of the family, is responsible. He was widely criticized for his extravagant lifestyle and his refusal to adapt to changing times. Others have argued that it was his son Patrick who caused the family’s downfall, due to his reckless spending and volatile temper.</p>
<p>However, a closer look at the evidence suggests that it was actually the daughters of Michael Donovan who were primarily responsible for the family’s decline. Katherine Donovan was widely criticized for her greed and nepotism, while Angela Donovan was known for her lavish parties and irresponsible spending.</p>
<p>It is clear that there was plenty of blame to go around within the Donovan family. But in the end, it was their own greed and immaturity that led to their downfall.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Nietzsche-be-Ruining-Another-Hollywood-Family"><a href="#Could-Nietzsche-be-Ruining-Another-Hollywood-Family" class="headerlink" title="Could Nietzsche be Ruining Another Hollywood Family?"></a>Could Nietzsche be Ruining Another Hollywood Family?</h1><p>It would seem that the Nietzsches are Hollywood’s dysfunctional family of choice. The latest entrants in this dubious distinction are actors Shia LaBeouf and his father, Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Shia has been very open about his mental health issues, and he has had several public meltdowns in which he has acted out in bizarre ways. His latest episode was when he interrupted a Broadway performance of Cabaret to shout slogans praising Donald Trump. Shia’s father, Jeffrey, has not been much help to him. He has been arrested for drunk driving and for assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Nietzsches are in need of some serious counseling. And it is quite possible that Friedrich Nietzsche is partly to blame for their problems. Nietzsche believed that mental illness was a sign of spiritual greatness. He saw it as a way of transcending the limitations of the ordinary human mind. This is a dangerous message to promote, especially to young people who are struggling with their mental health. It can give them the false impression that their mental problems are actually a good thing, and that they should embrace them instead of seeking treatment.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Nietzsche was entirely responsible for the rise in mental illness rates – there are many factors at play here. But his ideas have certainly played a role in exacerbating this problem. And Hollywood seems to be particularly drawn to his work – perhaps because its celebrity culture is so conducive to dysfunction and drama.</p>
<p>So far, no one in the Hollywood establishment has stepped up to address this issue. But maybe it is time for someone to do something about it before another family is destroyed by the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
