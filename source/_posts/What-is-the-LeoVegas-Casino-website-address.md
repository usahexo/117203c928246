#  What are the wagering requirements at LeoVegas Casino?

When you sign up at LeoVegas Casino, you will be asked to agree to the casino's wagering requirements. These requirements apply to all bonuses, including no-deposit bonuses, free spins, and matched deposits.

The wagering requirement at LeoVegas Casino is generally set at 25x the bonus amount. This means that you will need to playthrough (bet) 25 times the bonus amount before you can withdraw any winnings. For example, if you receive a €50 bonus, you will need to playthrough (€1250) €50 = €1250 in order to be able to cash out any winnings.

However, it is important to note that different games contribute different percentages towards the wagering requirements. Slot games typically contribute 100%, while table games (including blackjack and roulette) typically contribute only 10%. So if you're playing a slot game and bet €100 on it, €100 of your wagering requirement will be met. If you're playing a table game and bet €10 on it, only €1 of your wagering requirement will be met.

The good news is that LeoVegas Casino does offer some low wagering requirements on its bonuses. For example, its welcome bonus has a wagering requirement of just 15x the bonus amount. So if you receive a €100 bonus, you would only need to playthrough (€1500) €100 = €1500 in order to meet the requirements and cash out any winnings.

Overall, LeoVegas Casino has fairly reasonable wagering requirements when compared with other online casinos. So if you're looking for an online casino with fair requirements, LeoVegas should definitely be at the top of your list!
