The Togolese Republic is a small, sub-Saharan country on the Gulf of Guinea. It is one of the few countries in Africa without a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea.

The official language of Togo is French, with about 30% of the population speaking Ewe and the rest speaking various African languages. Christianity is the predominant religion, followed by Islam.

The economy of Togo is based largely on agriculture, with cocoa, coffee, and cotton being the primary exports. Petroleum products are also exported. The GDP per capita is relatively low, at just over US$1,000.

Togo gained its independence from France in 1960 and has been ruled by a series of dictators since then. In 1993, following a military coup, democracy was restored to Togo. The current president, Faure Gnassingbe, took office in 2005 after his father's death. He won re-election in 2010 and again in 2015 amid allegations of voting irregularities.
