There is nothing more frustrating than spending your hard-earned money on a game machine that isn’t working the way it should. If you are having problems with your Cherry Master Slot Machine Game Machine Togo, don’t worry – we have a solution for you!

The following fixes are guaranteed to get your machine working properly again:

#1.) CLEAN THE MACHINE

It is important to keep your game machine clean. The slots and other mechanisms can become clogged with dirt and dust, which can cause the machine to malfunction. Use a soft cloth to clean the entire surface of the machine, including the slots. Be sure to remove all traces of dirt and dust before moving on to the next step.

#2.) LUBRICATE THE MACHINE

If the machine is not lubricated, it can start to slow down or even stop working altogether. Use a special lubricant designed for game machines to coat all of the moving parts. This will help them move more smoothly and prevent them from wearing out over time.

#3.) INSERT A NEW BATTERY

If the machine is not getting power, it may be due to a dead battery. Remove the battery cover and replace the battery with a new one. Be sure to insert it in the correct orientation, as indicated by the polarity symbols (+/–). If you are not sure which side is which, check the instruction manual for your machine.

#4.) RESET THE MACHINE

If none of these solutions seem to be working, try resetting the machine. This will clear any glitches that may have occurred and restore the settings back to their default values. Consult your instruction manual for instructions on how to reset your particular machine.
