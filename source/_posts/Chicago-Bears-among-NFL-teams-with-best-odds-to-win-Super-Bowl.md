#  Chicago Bears among NFL teams with best odds to win Super Bowl

The Chicago Bears are one of the teams with the best odds to win the Super Bowl this season. The Bears have a lot of talent on their team, and they are looking to make a playoff run this year.

The Bears have a strong offense led by quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. Trubisky had a solid rookie season last year, and he is looking to build on that this year. The Bears also have a strong defense, which ranked third in the NFL last season.

The Bears will face some tough competition in the NFC this season, but they are definitely capable of making a run to the Super Bowl. If they can stay healthy and play well as a team, then there is no reason why they can't win it all.

#  Vegas has Bears as 9-1 odds to make playoffs

The Vegas odds-makers have the Chicago Bears pegged as a 9-1 shot to make the playoffs this year. The Bears are coming off of a dismal 3-13 campaign and will be looking to rebound under new head coach Matt Nagy.

Many experts are expecting big things from second-year quarterback Mitch Trubisky, who showed flashes of potential last season. The Bears also bolstered their offense in the offseason with the addition of wide receiver Allen Robinson.

Chicago's defense should also be improved under new coordinator Vic Fangio. The Bears have a number of talented young players, including defensive end Akiem Hicks, linebacker Leonard Floyd and cornerback Kyle Fuller.

Still, there are some questions about this team. Can Trubisky take the next step? Will the offense be able to score enough points? Can the defense carry them all year long?

These are all legitimate questions, but at least on paper, it looks like the Bears could be a playoff team this year.

#  Chicago Bears have third best odds to win the NFC North

The Bears enter the 2018 season with high expectations after signing quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to a four-year, $128 million contract extension in April. The Bears also added receivers Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel, tight end Trey Burton and running back Jordan Howard during the offseason. Chicago has the third-best odds (7-to-2) to win the NFC North, according to Caesars Palace.

The Bears open the season on Sept. 9 at home against the Packers. Green Bay has won six of the past seven meetings against Chicago, including a 24-23 victory in Week 1 last season. The Bears have not won a division title since 2010.

“We definitely have some talent on our team,” Trubisky said during training camp. “I’m just trying to do my part and put us in the best position to win games each week. We have a lot of playmakers on both sides of the ball and special teams, so I’m just trying to get everybody the ball and let them work their magic.”

Chicago is scheduled to play 12 games against opponents who made the playoffs last season, including six matchups against teams that reached the conference championship game. The Bears close out the regular season on Dec. 30 against the Vikings.

“It’s going to be a tough road ahead with all these playoff teams we’re playing, but we have just as good a chance as any team to win this division, or any other division for that matter,” linebacker Danny Trevathan said.

# Online sports betting legal for Chicago Bears fans

Online sports betting is now legal for Chicago Bears fans. This news comes as a result of the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).

Now that PASPA is overturned, each state is free to make its own decision on whether or not to legalize sports betting. Illinois is one of the states that has decided to legalize it, which means that Chicago Bears fans can now legally bet on their team’s games.

Sports betting is a big business, and it’s estimated that it will generate $150 billion in revenue each year. That’s a lot of money, and it’s no surprise that states are eager to get their piece of the pie.

Legalizing sports betting will undoubtedly create jobs and boost the economy. It will also bring in much-needed tax revenue for states, which is why so many of them are eager to legalize it.

There are some who are opposed to legalizing sports betting, but I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. I think that it should be legalized at the federal level so that everyone can benefit from it.

It will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few months and years. I’m sure that there will be plenty of debate on this issue, but I think that most people agree that legalizing sports betting is a good thing.

#  Chicago Bears opening at 5-1 odds to win Super Bowl

The Chicago Bears have made some big offseason acquisitions, including Khalil Mack and Allen Robinson. This has led to them opening at 5-1 odds to win the Super Bowl, according to Vegas Insider.

The Bears will have a lot of talent on both sides of the ball in 2018. Mack and Robinson headline an impressive offense that also includes Jordan Howard, Trey Burton, and Tarik Cohen. The defense is anchored by Mack, Eddie Jackson, Kyle Fuller, and Akiem Hicks.

Many people are expecting the Bears to take a big step forward in 2018 and make a run at the Super Bowl. If they can stay healthy, there is no reason why they can't contend for the title.

The Bears open the season with three tough games against the Packers, Seahawks, and Cardinals. They will get a chance to gauge where they stand early on in the season. If they can come out of those three games with a 2-1 record or better, it will show that they are a contender in the NFC.

Chicago has not won a Super Bowl since 1985. They have a chance to change that in 2018.
