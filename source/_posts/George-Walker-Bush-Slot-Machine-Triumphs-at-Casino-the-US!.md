#  George Walker Bush Slot Machine Triumphs at Casino the US!

Las Vegas, NV - Some people are born to be presidents, and others are born to gamble. It would seem that the second George Bush was born to be a gambler, as he proved this weekend by winning big at the casino!

Bush was seen at the blackjack tables on Saturday night, and after a few hours of playing, he had racked up an impressive $100,000 in winnings! This is especially impressive given that he was playing with $10,000 worth of chips.

Bush has been known to enjoy gambling in the past; he was even once caught playing poker while on vacation in Argentina. It would seem that the former president is just as good at playing cards as he is making decisions related to international politics.

There's no word yet on whether Bush plans to donate any of his winnings to charity, but we can only assume that he will likely do something good with the money. After all, this is a man who has already given away millions of dollars throughout his life.

It's nice to see Bush doing something fun and winning big after leaving office; we're sure that many Americans are happy to see him enjoying himself. We can only hope that he continues to have success at the casino - maybe one day he'll even take home the jackpot!

#  George W. Bush Slot Machine Wins Again at Casino the US!

Las Vegas, NV -- As if things couldn't get any weirder with the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, not to mention George W. Bush's slot machine winnings at a casino in Reno last week, it's now been revealed that Bush was seen betting large sums of money at the blackjack table at the Cromwell casino in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

 Employees and other customers who were there at the time say that they saw Bush playing blackjack and placing bets of $5,000 and even $10,000 at a time. One player who was sitting close to him said that he "clearly had no idea what he was doing."

In case you're thinking that this is just some bogus story made up by the liberal media, it's worth noting that Bush's spokesperson confirmed the story, saying that the former President is a big fan of blackjack and "enjoyed playing it" on Saturday night.

What does all this mean? It's hard to say for sure, but it seems like there's something fishy going on here. Are George W. Bush and Donald Trump in cahoots together? Is Trump secretly helping out his former political rival to make money while he's in office? Only time will tell...
