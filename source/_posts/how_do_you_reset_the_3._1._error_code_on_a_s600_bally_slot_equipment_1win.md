**How to Reset the 3.1 Error Code on a S600 Bally Slot Machine**

Bally is a well-known slot machine manufacturer that produces a variety of games with different features and themes. However, like any other machine, Bally slot machines may encounter errors that need to be fixed. One common error is the 3.1 error code, which means there is a problem with the hopper or coin payout mechanism. This article will guide you on how to reset the 3.1 error code on a S600 Bally slot machine.

Step 1: Turn Off the Machine

The first thing you need to do when encountering the 3.1 error code is to turn off the slot machine. This will prevent any further damage to the machine and ensure your safety while working on it.

Step 2: Open the Cabinet

Once the machine is turned off, locate the cabinet door at the bottom of the slot machine. Open the door and look for the hopper and coin payout mechanism.

Step 3: Check the Hopper and Coin Payout Mechanism

Inspect the hopper and coin payout mechanism for any obstructions, such as coins or debris, that may be causing the error code. Clear out any obstructions that you find and ensure that the hopper and payout mechanism are functioning properly.

Step 4: Reset the Error Code

To reset the error code, locate the black button on the MPU (Master Processing Unit) board inside the machine. Press and hold the button for three to five seconds until the 3.1 error code disappears.

Step 5: Close the Cabinet

After resetting the error code, close the cabinet door and turn the machine back on. Test the machine to ensure that it is functioning properly and that the error code does not reappear.
