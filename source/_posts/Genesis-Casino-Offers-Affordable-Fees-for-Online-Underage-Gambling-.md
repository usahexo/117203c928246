#  Casino offers low rates for online gambling by minors 

Casinos are now offering low rates to gamble online in order to attract a new generation of customers. With this, casino operators hope that minors will also be drawn to the gambling tables.

One casino is currently offering a promotion that allows players to gamble for free in its casino games. In addition, it is also offering bonus credits that can be used in any of its games.

According to the casino's marketing head, this is an attempt to get more players into their casino and hopefully increase the number of returning customers. "Online gambling has become more popular in recent years and we want to make sure that we offer our players good value for their money," she said in an interview.

The casino is not alone in its efforts; other casinos are also offering low rates and promotional deals to get players into their casinos. This is in light of the increasing competition among casinos as well as the slowdown in the global economy.

While minors may be enticed by these low rates, operators say that they have measures in place to ensure that minors do not gamble online. "We have age verification mechanisms in place which ensure that only those over 18 can access our site and gamble," said an operator from one of the leading online casinos.

Even so, some experts believe that there should be a stricter regulation on online gambling especially when it comes to minors. "The fact that casinos are now targeting minors through these low rates is a cause for concern," said one expert on gambling addiction.
