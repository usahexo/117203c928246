#  Lucky Twins Jackpot Game Pays Out $7,812.02

A player at a Michigan casino hit it big on the Lucky Twins slot game, walking away with over $7,800.

The lucky player was spinning the reels on the Lucky Twins game at the Motor City Casino when they landed on the bonus round. This paid out $7,812.02 to the player, who celebrated their huge winnings with other guests at the casino.

The Lucky Twins slot game is a five-reel and 20-payline game that offers players the chance to win big payouts. The game is themed around two adorable twins who are each holding a bag of coins, with symbols on the reels including dollar signs, hearts, stars and clovers.

In order to land on the bonus round, players need to get three Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels. This will award 10 free spins in which all prizes are doubled. If players manage to land three more Bonus symbols during the free spins, they will receive an additional 10 free spins – meaning they could potentially play for 30 free spins and double their winnings every time.

This isn’t the first big win that has been seen on this particular slot game – back in January 2017 a player in Illinois managed to win over $21,000 from a single spin on the game. This goes to show that if you’re lucky enough to land on the bonus round, you could be walking away with some serious cash prizes.
