#  Nevada is the cheapest place to get a gambling license according to the Zodiac Fortune report!

Nevada has always been a gambling Mecca for people around the world. It is not only the birthplace of Las Vegas but it is also one of the cheapest places to get a gambling license.

The Zodiac Fortune report recently came out and it ranked Nevada as the cheapest place to get a gambling license. This is great news for people who are looking to get into the gambling industry because it means that they can save a lot of money on licensing fees.

There are a few other states that offer cheaper licensing fees, but Nevada offers the best value overall. It has low taxes and plenty of gambling venues, so businesses can get up and running quickly and easily.

Nevada has been working hard to attract more gambling businesses in recent years, and this new ranking will only help to solidify its position as the top destination for gambling businesses. If you’re looking to get into the gaming industry, then Nevada should definitely be at the top of your list!

#  Cheap gambling licenses in Macau? Not anymore!

For a few years, Macau has been offering very cheap gambling licenses. This made the territory an attractive option for casino operators, as regulatory compliance and related costs were much lower than in other jurisdictions. However, the Macau government has recently announced that it will be raising the price of gambling licenses.

The new licensing fees will range from $225,000 to $1.5 million per year, depending on the size of the casino. This is a significant increase from the current rates, which range from $7,000 to $60,000 per year. The government is justifying the increase by citing the need to cover rising costs associated with regulating the gambling industry.

The new fees will take effect in September 2018. Casino operators who have already obtained a license are not affected by the change, but those who are still in the process of applying will need to pay the higher rates.

This move is likely to result in increased costs for casino operators doing business in Macau. It may also cause some of them to reconsider their plans for expansion in the territory. Nevertheless, Macau remains one of the most lucrative gambling markets in the world, and it is likely that many companies will continue to operate there despite the increased fees.
