#  Gambler Turns $10 Into $1,000 After Predicting Correct Outcome Of Togo Soccer Match

At the ripe age of 23, Nicolas Frantz had turned $10 into an impressive sum of $1,000 after correctly predicting the outcome of a soccer game between Togo and Morocco. The odds were certainly not in his favour, as he placed his bet on Morocco to win with a 100-to-1 payout.

Frantz is originally from Lyon, France but was in Togo visiting family when he learned of the match and placed his bet at a local casino. After watching Morocco dominate the game and eventually win 2-0, Frantz cashed in on his lucky prediction.

"It's not about the money," Frantz said in an interview following his winnings. "I just love predicting the correct outcome of sports matches."

This is not Frantz's first big gambling win – he has previously won over $2,000 by betting on horses. However, this latest victory is by far his most impressive yet. When asked what he plans to do with his windfall, Frantz said that he will be using it to travel more and explore new places.

Whether you're a seasoned gambler or just starting out, it's always important to do your research before placing a bet. Make sure to know all the relevant facts about the game – including who is playing, what the odds are, and what the possible outcomes could be. Of course, luck also plays a role, so don't be afraid to place a few bets on underdog teams every now and then!

#  Bettor loses out after backing Togo to win

In what can only be seen as a massive betting blunder, a local Bettor is understood to have placed a sizeable wager on Togo to win the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations.

The unfortunate gambler is reported to have staked EUR 100 on the underdog African side, only for them to lose 2-1 to Guinea in their opening game.

With the likes of Ivory Coast, Ghana and Algeria all in Group D, it now looks like a very tall order for Togo to make it through to the knockout stages.

This isn't the first time that this particular Bettor has lost out heavily betting on football matches. In fact, it's understood that he has lost thousands of euros backing doomed causes in the past. This latest setback is likely to sting even more, given that he placed such a large sum on Togo.

Interestingly, many other gamblers managed to make a profit by betting on Guinea - including one who cashed in by predicting that the match would end in a draw.

So, while this particular Bettor faces an agonising wait for his team's remaining fixtures, others will be counting their winnings and enjoying the spectacle of the Africa Cup of Nations.

#  Woman Makes $1,000 After correctly predicting Togo's soccer game

In a recent soccer game between Togo and Benin, 25-year-old woman Cassandra Koffi accurately predicted the outcome of the match.  Koffi placed a bet at the last minute on Togo to win, earning herself a cool $1,000 in the process.

This is not the first time that Koffi has correctly predicted a soccer game. In fact, she has a 75% success rate when it comes to predicting soccer matches.  What makes her so successful? According to Koffi, it's all about studying the players and their histories: "I just watch a lot of games and try to do my own analysis. I look at how teams have been playing in their latest games and also check out any injuries."

Interestingly, Koffi does not have any formal training in sports analytics or statistics; she simply relies on her intuition and knowledge of the game. And it seems that this combination has served her well so far! 

Koffi's remarkable success is turning heads in Togo, where she is now considered something of a local celebrity. In addition to her $1,000 payday from the Benin game, she has also won several small bets from friends and family members. 

Who knows? If Cassandra Koffi can keep up her stellar record, maybe she can parlay her skills into a career as a professional sports analyst!

In a stunning upset, Togo pulled off a 1-0 victory over Tunisia on Saturday in the African Cup of Nations, earning themselves a place in the semifinals against Egypt. The victory was particularly surprising given that Togo is a much weaker side than Tunisia and had been slight underdogs leading up to the game.

The result sent shockwaves through the gambling world, with one British man standing to make an astonishing $1,000 after betting on Togo to lose. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, placed a $10 bet on Togo to lose at odds of 10/1 and watched as they pulled off the upset win.

"I couldn't believe it when I saw the final score," he said. "I thought for sure I was going to lose my money, but I guess luck was on my side today."

The win caps off a bumper weekend for punters, with Leicester City shocking the football world by winning the Premier League title. Leicester were 5,000/1 outsiders at the start of the season but defied all odds to lift the trophy on Saturday.
