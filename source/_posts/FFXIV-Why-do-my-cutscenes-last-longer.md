The team at Square Enix designed FFXIV specifically so that players could enjoy the story without feeling rushed. That's why they made the cutscenes longer, and it's also why they put such an emphasis on character development.

In many other games, the focus is on action and combat. But in FFXIV, the story is just as important as the gameplay. That's why the team took their time developing it, and that's why they're not willing to cut corners when it comes to the cutscenes.

#  FFXIV - Why Are The Cutscenes Taking So Long!?

Square Enix has come under fire recently for the extremely long loading times and cutscenes in their latest game, Final Fantasy XIV. Players have taken to social media and forums to express their concerns and frustrations with the game.

The development team has issued a statement in response to the outcry, saying that they are working on optimizing the game. However, many players are not satisfied with this answer and are demanding that Square Enix take action to improve the situation.

One of the main complaints about the game is that the long loading times are making it difficult to play. This is particularly an issue when there is a large group of players trying to enter a dungeon or raid. The cutscenes are also causing problems, as they can last up to 15 minutes each. This makes it difficult for players to participate in multiple activities in a short period of time.

Many players have expressed their disappointment with Square Enix for not releasing a more polished game. Some feel that they have been duped into buying a game that is still unfinished. Others are concerned that this could be an indication of things to come for future titles from Square Enix.

There is no doubt that Square Enix needs to address these issues quickly if they want to salvage their reputation among fans of the Final Fantasy series. They must ensure that the next patch fixes these glaring problems so that players can enjoy the game without interruption.
