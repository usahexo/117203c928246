There are many ways to make money as a professional gamer. You can compete in tournaments, become a gaming commentator or streamer, or work for a video game developer.

#  Tax-Free Gaming is Here to Stay

The Isle of Man, a small country located in the British Isles, is well-known for its low taxes and business-friendly environment. The country has had a long history of being a tax haven and has successfully lured businesses away from other countries with its favorable tax laws.

One of the latest industries to benefit from the Isle of Man's low taxes is online gaming. Thanks to the Isle of Man's Gaming Act 2001, online gaming companies can operate here tax-free. This has made the Isle of Man a popular destination for online gaming companies, and many well-known brands have set up shop here.

The benefits of tax-free gaming are clear. Not only does it help attract online gaming companies to the Isle of Man, it also helps create jobs and boost the local economy. In addition, by operating tax-free, online gaming companies can offer their products and services at lower prices than their competitors, which is great news for consumers.

Given the benefits of tax-free gaming, it's no surprise that this trend is here to stay. The Isle of Man is well positioned to be the global leader in this industry, and I'm confident that it will continue to thrive in the years ahead.

#  New Gaming Tax Could Hurt Industry

A new gaming tax in Illinois could hurt the state’s burgeoning video game industry, according to industry experts.

The new tax, which takes effect July 1, will increase the levy on video game purchases from 6.25 percent to 10 percent. That could lead to a loss of jobs and investment in the industry, which is growing rapidly in Illinois.

“This is not good news for our industry,’’ said Greg Costikyan, an independent game designer who has consulted for several video game companies. “It’s just another obstacle for us to overcome.’’

Since 2007, the number of video game development studios in Illinois has doubled to 60, thanks largely to a $3 million program that offers tax credits and grants to companies that create games with an Illinois connection.

The new gaming tax would apply not only to video games but also to apps and other digital content sold online.

#  Video Games Now Taxable in Most States

Video game sales have been a huge industry for decades. But what does the future hold for this multi-billion dollar market?

Most states have begun to tax video games, and the trend is likely to continue. The rationale behind this move is that video games are now considered entertainment, just like movies or concerts. And since these forms of entertainment are typically taxable, it only makes sense to levy a tax on video games as well.

The tax rates vary from state to state, but they typically range from 5% to 10%. This may not seem like a lot, but it can add up over time. In California, for example, the tax rate is 8.84%. So if you purchase a $60 video game, you will end up paying an additional $5 in taxes.

Not everyone is happy about this development. Some gamers argue that video games should be exempt from taxation because they are used for educational purposes. Others maintain that taxing video games is a regressive measure that disproportionately affects poorer consumers.

Whatever side of the debate you fall on, there’s no doubt that video game taxes are here to stay. So if you’re planning on buying any new titles in the near future, be sure to factor in the additional cost!

#  Is Your State One of the Few that Tax Video Games?

The debate over whether or not to tax video games has been a topic of discussion for years. But, which states actually tax video games?

According to The Tax Foundation, as of 2019, the following states taxes video games: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio and Rhode Island.

While the list is changing all the time, these are the states that have been known to tax video games in some form or another. For example, in Alabama, you’ll pay a 10% sales tax on video games. In Illinois, you’ll pay a 6.25% use tax on all digital downloads including video games.

But what about the other states? Are they all exempt from taxation?

Unfortunately, no. In fact, most states do not have a specific tax for video games. However, many of these states do have a sales or use tax that applies to digital downloads including video games. So while there may not be a specific “video game tax” per se, you may still be responsible for paying sales or use taxes on these items.

For instance, in California – which does not have a specific video game tax – digital downloads are subject to the state’s 7.5% sales tax. And in Texas – which also does not have a specific video game tax – any tangible personal property (including digital downloads) is subject to the state’s 6.25% sales and use taxes combined.

So if you’re wondering if your state taxes video games, it’s important to look into the specifics of your state’s sales and use tax laws. Because while some states do have a specific video game tax, most states will still require you to pay sales or use taxes on any digital downloads including video games.
