#  Casino being built near Rehoboth Beach

Residents of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware are voicing concerns over a casino being built near their town. The casino, which is set to be built by the FunQuest company, will be located just outside of Rehoboth Beach and will include a hotel and 300-400 gaming machines.

Many residents are unhappy with the prospect of a casino opening near their town, citing concerns over traffic, crime, and decreased property values. Some are even planning to organize a protest against the casino.

FunQuest is hoping to have the casino open by the end of 2019.

#  Slot machines coming to Delaware shoreline

Delaware officials have given the green light for slot machines to be installed at the state’s shoreline, in a move that is expected to bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped local businesses.

The unanimous vote by the Delaware State Park Board means that machines will be available at five locations along the coast, including Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach.

The decision has been welcomed by business owners in the area, many of whom have seen their revenues decline in recent years as tourists have opted to spend their money elsewhere.

“This is great news for our business community,” said Dewey Beach Mayor Diana Vaughan. “The addition of slot machines will help us to compete with other beach towns and bring in much-needed revenue.”

Revenue from the slots is expected to be shared among the state, local businesses and casino operators. In addition, a portion of the money raised will be used to fund programs that benefit Delaware residents, such as tourism promotion and job training initiatives.

Opposition to the move was initially strong, but appears to have dissipated in recent months. While there are still some who oppose gambling on moral grounds, many others have come around to the idea of using it to generate much-needed revenue.

“I don’t like gambling, but I can see how this could be good for our community,” said Rehoboth resident Peggy Lynch. “I hope it brings in a lot of money so we can get our economy back on track.”

#  Casino resort to open near Rehoboth Beach

Delaware's first casino resort is set to open in late 2018, just south of Rehoboth Beach. The $110 million project will include a casino with 850 slot machines and 26 table games, a hotel with 225 rooms, a spa, a restaurant, and a pool.

The casino resort is being developed by Delaware Park Gaming & Entertainment LLC, a subsidiary of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. "The casino resort will create jobs and generate economic activity for Delaware," said Governor John Carney. "We are pleased to welcome the Chickasaw Nation as our newest partners in gaming and economic development."

Rehoboth Beach officials are excited about the new development. "This is great news for Rehoboth Beach," said Mayor Paul Kuhns. "A casino resort will bring new visitors to our town and support our businesses."

Casino resorts are becoming increasingly popular throughout the country. There are now 33 states that have authorized some form of legalized gambling, and there are more than 1,600 casinos nationwide. In 2017, gambling revenue totaled $41.7 billion, up 3% from 2016.

The arrival of a casino resort near Rehoboth Beach is good news for Sussex County tourism. In 2017, tourists spent nearly $2 billion in Sussex County, up 5% from 2016. The casino resort is expected to attract an additional 300,000 visitors per year to the area.

#  Delaware casino plans stir up debate in neighboring state

Residents in Pennsylvania are divided on the question of whether a new casino proposed for Delaware will have a negative effect on their state's economy. Those in favor of the casino believe that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue, while those opposed claim that it will only lead to more gambling addiction and bankruptcies.

The proposed casino, which would be built just across the Delaware state line, has already sparked a heated debate between lawmakers in both states. Pennsylvania Senator Mike Stack is one of the opponents of the casino, and he worries that it will siphon away business from existing casinos in his state. "We've seen what happens when you have cannibalization of casinos," he said. "It's not good for anybody."

Delaware officials, however, argue that the new casino will create much-needed jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to their state. They believe that it will be a major tourist attraction, and they are prepared to fight hard for its approval. "This is an important project for Delaware," said Governor John Carney. "It will create jobs and generate economic activity."

The fate of the proposed casino now rests with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, which is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks.

#  Proposed casino raises concerns for Rehoboth Beach businesses

The news of a new casino proposed for Rehoboth Beach has raised concerns among some business owners in the area. While some see the potential boon for business that a new casino could bring, others are worried about the impact it could have on their already struggling enterprises.

"We're very concerned about its impact on small businesses," said one owner who asked to remain anonymous. "It won't be good for us if people can come to town and gamble instead of spending their money at our stores and restaurants."

Some local officials are also speaking out against the casino, saying that it will do nothing but harm the small businesses in the area. "This is a Coastal resort town, not Atlantic City," said Mayor Paul Kuhns. "We don't need another casino."

Despite the protests, the developers seem determined to move forward with their plans. They argue that the casino will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the area. They also say that it will be geared towards locals, not out-of-town visitors.

Only time will tell whether or not this new casino will be good for Rehoboth Beach businesses. In the meantime, owners will just have to wait and see what happens.
