#  Olympiacos spends €1 million per day on sports betting

According to a report by the Greek sports website sport24.gr, Olympiacos spends about €1 million every day on sports betting. This is in addition to the money that the club already spends on player salaries, transfers and other expenses.

Olympiacos is not the only club in Greece that spends a lot of money on sports betting. The same website reports that PAOK, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens also spend a significant amount of money on gambling. In fact, PAOK is believed to spend as much as €2 million per day on sports betting.

The high spending by these clubs has led to concerns that they are using illegal methods to obtain an edge over their opponents. For example, it is alleged that some clubs are paying off referees in order to get favourable results.

While there is no concrete evidence to support these allegations, they do raise some serious questions about the integrity of Greek football. If these allegations are proven to be true, it could lead to major rule changes and even the suspension of some clubs from competition.

#  Betting company director arrested for allegedly laundering Olympiacos' money 

A betting company director has been arrested for allegedly laundering money from Olympiacos, one of Greece's biggest football clubs.

The 43-year-old suspect is accused of taking €200,000 (£170,000) from the club and converting it into cash which he then used to gamble on online casino websites.

Police believe the money was originally sent to the suspect by Olympiacos to launder, but they have not ruled out the possibility that some of it may have been legitimately earned by the betting company.

Officers carried out a series of raids on Tuesday morning as part of their investigation, seizing cash, computers and documents.

The suspect is due to appear before a prosecutor later on Tuesday.

The main purpose of this article is to enlighten the general public about Olympiacos' successful sports betting and the turn it has taken into a multi-million euro business. Apparently, Olympiacos' neighbour, a well-known betting provide, has been extremely impressed by their recent profitability and decided to offer them sponsorship. This is a great opportunity for the club as they continue to grow and expand their business.

According to sources, Olympiacos' sports betting turnover amounts to millions of euros per year. Their success can be attributed to various factors such as their vast knowledge of the sport, their experience in the field and their intimate connection with the club's players and staff. In addition, they have developed a number of sophisticated software programmes which help them make informed decisions about their bets.

This lucrative business venture has not only benefitted Olympiacos financially but it has also helped create jobs and stimulate the local economy. The club now employs dozens of people who are responsible for making sure that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Furthermore, it is estimated that around 100 additional jobs have been indirectly created due to this enterprise.

In light of all this, it comes as no surprise that Olympiacos' sports betting is considered one of the most successful in Europe. They continue to break records and make a considerable profit each year. This has enabled them to build a strong foundation for future growth and development.Sponsorship from a major betting provider will only serve to enhance their reputation and help them reach even greater heights.

#  Judge orders seizure of €10 million from Olympiacos' betting account 

A Greek court has ruled that Olympiacos' betting account be seized as part of an investigation into match-fixing.

Prosecutors allege that club president Evangelos Marinakis instructed his team to fix matches in the country's top division, the Superleague, between 2010 and 2013.

Marinakis has denied any wrongdoing and said he will appeal the ruling.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Olympiacos said the move amounted to "a hostile takeover against one of Greece's most successful clubs."

The sum ordered to be seized is €10 million, which was deposited in the account by Olympiacos for bets on matches in the period in question. 

This is just the latest development in a long-running saga which has rocked Greek football. In May 2017, a dozen people, including two former referees, were arrested as part of the probe. 

Earlier this year, Olympiacos were deducted three points and fined €100,000 after being found guilty of trying to fix a match against AEL Larissa. 

The club have since announced they are withdrawing from this season's Champions League in protest at what they consider to be unfair treatment by European governing body UEFA.

#  Sports betting big business for Olympiacos as club looks to offload stake

Olympiacos, one of the most successful clubs in European football, is looking to cash in on its stake in a major sports betting company.

The Greek giants have put their 10% share in OPAP up for sale, with the hope of raising around €80 million.

This move comes as no surprise, as Olympiacos have been looking to sell their stake for some time now. The money raised will go towards the redevelopment of their stadium and other infrastructure projects.

OPAP is the largest gaming company in Greece, and is expected to be worth around €2.5 billion when it goes public later this year.

Olympiacos are not the only club with a stake in OPAP – six other teams also hold shares in the company. However, it is thought that Olympiacos will be the first to sell its stake, with AC Milan and Inter Milan likely to follow suit.
