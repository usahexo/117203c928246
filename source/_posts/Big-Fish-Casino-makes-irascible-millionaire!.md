#  Big Fish Casino makes irascible millionaire!

Break out the champagne – or at least some good bubbly, because there’s a new millionaire in town! And, yes, this one hails from the virtual world of Big Fish Casino.

An irate player going by the handle “DhanushKarthi” hit the big one over the weekend, walking away with an impressive $1.3 million payday. How did he do it? By playing the slots, of course!

The Indian national has been quoted as saying he was feeling rather angry after having a bad day at work, so he decided to log-in to his favorite casino and vent his frustrations on the reels. Apparently it worked – as soon as he hit the jackpot he began screaming with joy and disbelief.

It’s not clear what DhanushKarthi is going to do with his winnings just yet, but one thing is for sure – he won’t have any trouble spending it! With millions in his bank account, he can pretty much buy anything (or anyone) he wants. Perhaps a new house, a luxury car or even a private island? The possibilities are endless!

In case you were wondering, this isn’t the only big win that Big Fish Casino has had lately. Only last month another lucky player took home an astonishing $2 million prize. So if you feel like giving it a go and striking it rich yourself, what are you waiting for? Start spinning those reels and see if Lady Luck is on your side!

#  Casino life ruining couple's relationship

A casino can be a fun place to spend an evening, but for one couple in Michigan, it became a source of contention and eventually ended their relationship.

The two had been dating for about a year when they decided to visit a casino near their home. They had both enjoyed playing the slots in the past, so they thought it would be a fun way to spend an evening.

But things didn't go as planned. The boyfriend started spending more and more time at the machines, while the girlfriend found herself sitting alone at the table games. She eventually became bored and left to find her boyfriend.

When she couldn't find him, she asked one of the casino employees where he was. The employee told her that her boyfriend was in the high-roller section of the casino and that he had been there for several hours.

The girlfriend was angry and upset that her boyfriend had spent so much time gambling without her. She accused him of choosing the casino over their relationship. The argument turned ugly, and the couple ended up breaking up soon after.

It's possible that things might have turned out differently if they had gone to the casino together. But because they were each doing their own thing, it created tension between them and led to their breakup.

#  Gambling addict risks everything for big win

Gambling addiction can be a very dangerous habit, as one man in China recently learned. The 50-year-old addict, who has not been identified, had racked up millions of yuan in debts after years of gambling. On January 9th, he placed his last bet - a 500,000 yuan (around $73,000) wager on a Mahjong game. He won, and walked away with nearly 6 million yuan (nearly $1 million).

According to reports, the man has been gambling since he was a teenager. He had lost all his money many times before, but this time was different. He quit his job and emptied his bank account to place the massive bet. "I've been through dark times before, but I've never been so determined," he said. "This time I was going to win no matter what."

Unfortunately for the man, his victory was short-lived. Police arrested him just two days later when they discovered he still owed millions of yuan in gambling debts. It is unclear what will happen to him now that he has won such a large sum of money.
